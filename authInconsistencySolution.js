To mitigate the issue, consider using a more robust state management solution that can handle asynchronous updates and potential race conditions.  You could employ a global state management library (like Redux or Zustand) or manage the authentication state directly in your application's state, carefully handling potential inconsistencies using promises or async/await.  The example below uses promises to ensure that the authentication state is properly updated before performing subsequent actions.

```javascript
// authInconsistencySolution.js
import { getAuth, onAuthStateChanged } from 'firebase/auth';

const auth = getAuth();
let isAuthResolved = false; // Flag to prevent race conditions
let user = null; // Store user to prevent multiple calls

const resolveAuthState = () => new Promise((resolve) => {
  onAuthStateChanged(auth, (currentUser) => {
    user = currentUser;
    isAuthResolved = true;
    resolve(currentUser);
  });
});

// Example usage
export const getCurrentUser = async () => {
  if (!isAuthResolved) {
    await resolveAuthState();
  }
  return user;
};

// Example of how to use getCurrentUser
export const checkAuthAndProceed = async () => {
  const currentUser = await getCurrentUser();
  if (currentUser) {
    // Proceed with authorized actions
  } else {
    // Handle unauthorized actions
  }
};
```
