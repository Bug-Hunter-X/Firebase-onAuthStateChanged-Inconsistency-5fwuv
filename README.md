This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener.  In certain circumstances (multiple tabs, rapid authentication changes), the listener may fail to update the application state correctly.  The `authInconsistency.js` file reproduces the problem, while `authInconsistencySolution.js` offers a potential mitigation strategy. This issue can lead to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on real-time authentication updates.
